# ML-models
Repo contain implementation of some ML modes.

## 1. Directories overview
### 1.1 CycleGAN

There is my implementation of cycleGAN, based predominantly on origin paper.
Implementation uses tensorflow package.
Note, that model was tested only with MNIST data, however good result was achieved.

### 1.2 Ml-models from-scrath
There are some classical ML models, implemented only with numpy and emded python utils for a kind a educational purposes.
Folder consist of subfolders, for each model correspondingly.
Each models folder has some utils files, main file with the model actually (it has the same name, as directory) and `run.ipynb` jupyter notebook, which contain example with artificaly generated data and more detailed description of methods.
